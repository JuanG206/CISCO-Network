Project Summary: Enterprise Network Implementation in Cisco Packet Tracer
Objective

The goal of this project was to design, configure, and implement a fully operational enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer, ensuring all devices communicate seamlessly while following best networking practices.
Network Design and Implementation

    Topology Design
        Designed a structured network with four routers, three switches, multiple PCs, laptops, smartphones, and servers.
        Divided the network into three subnets, interconnected via routers and switches.
        Ensured that all routers were connected using fiber optic links for high-speed communication.

    IP Addressing & Subnetting
        WAN Network: Configured with a Class A IP address (10.0.x.x/24).
        Local Networks: Configured with Class C IP addresses (192.168.x.x/24).
        Assigned static IPs to routers and servers, while all other devices used DHCP for automatic IP assignment.

    Router and Switch Configuration
        Configured GigabitEthernet and FastEthernet interfaces for inter-router and router-switch connections.
        Implemented static and dynamic routing (RIP protocol) to enable communication across subnets.
        Verified connectivity using ping and traceroute commands.

    Wireless Network Integration
        Deployed an AP-PT (Access Point) to enable WiFi connectivity for mobile devices (laptops and smartphones).
        Configured SSID and DHCP to allow seamless wireless access.

    Server Configuration
        DHCP Server: Assigned IP addresses dynamically to all network devices except routers and servers.
        DNS Server: Configured a domain name system to resolve network domain names.
        DMZ Implementation: Created a DMZ zone without direct internal access, ensuring additional security for public-facing servers.

    Testing and Troubleshooting
        Verified inter-device communication within and across subnets using ping, traceroute, and show ip route.
        Ensured all workstations, servers, and mobile devices could reach external networks.
        Identified and resolved issues related to routing, IP conflicts, and connectivity.
